          <p class="description">Northwestern University '19</p>
          <p>I'm a junior pursuing a BA in Math and Econ as well as a minor in Computer Science.
          I am the Director of Sprout, an immersion program in Silicon Valley for 25 Northwestern undergrads to experience entrepreneurship firsthand and to develop
          creative thinking and problem-solving skills to become innovators in their communities. I am very lucky to have met and befriended so many bright, talented people
          while at college and the life lessons I have learned along the way are invaluable. I have also done work-study in addition to my studies.</p>
          <p>Freshman year I helped Northwestern's Weinberg IT in developing authorization policies in PHP for a base application to be used by every school at Northwestern.
          I also started work on creating a new app to map data from the Student Enterprise System (Oracle PeopleSoft) to the advisor portal (Symplicity).
          and CMS (Instructure Canvas). </p>
          <p>I helped Dr. Maryam Kouchaki my sophomore year in running studies analyzing ethical behavior such as lying when money is involved.</p>
          <p>On campus I enjoy playing pickup basketball, cooking food with friends and the occasional karoake night.</p>

          <p class="location">Cleveland, OH</span></p>
          <p class="description">Born and Raised, 2 Summer Internships @ Sherwin-Williams</p>
          <p>I grew up and went to public high school in Solon, a suburb 25 minutes south-east of Cleveland.</p>
